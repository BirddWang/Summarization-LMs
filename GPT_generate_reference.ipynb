Emergency room physician Dr. John Hink rushed to the scene to help, and volunteers, EMTs, and officials worked together to rescue 55 people in less than two hours. Survivors described feeling like they were going to die as the bridge collapsed, with one man's truck getting ripped in half but miraculously surviving.\n"
